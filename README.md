# Docs-Mini-App-React-Framer-Motion
My Docs Mini App is a simple document preview application built with React and animated using Framer Motion. It allows users to view document cards with file descriptions, file sizes, and additional features like download and close options. The application uses drag-and-drop animations for an interactive user experience.
